## Description

As a user, I want to be able to post details to all other users about my trips.
When I log in, I am presented with all the posts on the homepage.
When I click on a post, I am redirected to view the whole post on another page.
When I logout, I am unable to view all the posts on the homepage.
When I click on profits and am logged in, I am able to create a post. 
When I am about to create a post, I am able to search up the location in a search bar and activities available in the city are presented as check boxes.
When I select on check boxes and create the post, the post contains only the activities I selected.
When I am on my profile and click delete on one of my posts, the post is deleted.
